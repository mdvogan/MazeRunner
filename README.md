Tabular Reinforcement Learning for Maze Navigation

This is a practice project to implement tabular reinforcement
learning algorithms from scratch to navigate random mazes

Algorithms considered will include:

1) Dynamic programming value Iteration
2) Monte Carlo (on and off policy)
3) Q-Learning
4) Expected SARSA
